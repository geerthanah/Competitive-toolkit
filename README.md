#  Competitive Programming Toolkit

This is a pure algorithm-based Python project with zero machine learning.

## Features:
- Sorting & searching
- Graph and dynamic programming problems
- Greedy algorithms (e.g., job scheduler)
- Problem solvers (Maze, Expressions, etc.)
- Unit testing support

Run it with:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/geerthanah/competitive-toolkit.git
    cd competitive-toolkit
    ```


2. **Run the main program:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Folder Structure

- `main.py` — Entry point for running algorithms.
- `algorithms/` — Contains sorting, searching, graph, and DP implementations.
- `tests/` — Unit tests for algorithms.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.
